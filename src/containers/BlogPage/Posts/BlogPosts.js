    title: "Four Things To Know Before Recruitment",
    summary: `The Sorority Swap Thoughts: No. 6`,

      "Recruitment is an exciting time of the year when women interested in joining a sorority get to visit each chapter on their schools campus. For those new to recruitment, it can be a daunting experience, but we’re here to tell you that it’s nothing to be worried about!",
      "*Everything Works Out",
      "I say this first because it is the most important thing to remember while going through recruitment. Recruitment is a hectic time with conversations, meeting new people, and running from house to house. The sorority you desire to join in the moment may not be the perfect fit for you. As potential new members, we are unable to see this, but recruiters can. If your top choice isn’t the sorority you get, don’t worry. The place that found you knows it’s your home!",
      "*It’s Okay to Be Confused",
      "Walking into the first sorority on day one of recruitment is nerve-wracking. Your head will turn in different directions as you hear chanting and you may feel overwhelmed with where to go. It’s important to remember that the recruiters will always be by your side and guide you with what is happening in the recruitment process.",
      "Your Rho Gammas are there to help you as well. If you have questions or concerns, don’t be afraid to ask them. They want to help as much as they can.",
      "*Asking Questions is Important",
      "When speaking to someone during recruitment, don’t be afraid to ask questions! Learning about each sorority individually can be difficult, but it’s our job as recruiters to help ease the process for you.",
      "If the person recruiting you mentions something you are unsure of, or if you’re curious about certain activities, ask them about it. Asking questions will not only help you learn more but show them you are interested in what the sorority does.",
      "Recruiters want to get to know you as a person, but they also want to see that you are interested in the place they call home!",
      "*Stay True to Yourself",
      "Throughout it all, remember that it can be easy to change your personality to match the person you are talking to, but try to avoid doing this. Recruiters want to know who you are and pretending to be someone you’re not or someone similar to them will not influence the likelihood of them recommending you.",
      "It’s important to stay true to yourself because that’s all the recruiter wants to see. Recruitment is a time for learning. Potential New Members learn about the sororities on campus and the people who represent them while recruiters take the time to learn about the Potential New Members who may be the future of their chapter."

      "Bid Day is a special day where new members get to run home to their sorority and meet all of their sisters! The sorority members, especially those in charge of Bid Day, spend a lot of time planning their Bid Day theme.",
      "Here are our favorite Bid Day themes for Spring 2023! ",
      "*Girls Just Wanna Have Fun",
      "This theme is extremely fun with its seventies disco vibe! The bright orange, pink, and white colors make the theme an easy outfit find! Depending on whether you want pants, shorts, or skirts, these colors are very common in today’s fashion and can even be found with accessories too!",
      "What can you wear for shoes?",
      "Platform shoes were common in the seventies and have circled their way back to today! Many different shoes today have platforms, such as heals, boots, and even sneakers.",
      "Go crazy with the hair! Try out fun hairstyles like bubble braids or add in colorful hair extensions or clips!",
      "Check out Kappa Delta at Georgia Southern University’s Instagram to see an amazing example!",
      "*The Future of…",
      "The future of your sorority! This theme is full of different colors and lots of metallics! It’s the time to try out crazy sunglasses and fun shoes!

      "You can ask the members of your sorority to bake goods so the theme really comes to life!",
      "Everyone loves a sweet treat! This theme allows you to get creative and make it the most appetizing Bid Day ever!",
      "Check out Sigma Kappa at the University of Tampa’s Instagram page to see an amazing example!",

    title: "What Is It Like Starting Over?",
    summary: `The Sorority Swap Thoughts: No. 4`,
    author: "Sarrah George",
    imgUrl: startingOverImage,
    body: [
      "*What Is It Like Starting Over?",
      "Starting over in a college atmosphere can be extremely difficult, especially when you’re used to a routine. Even now, as I hope to go to graduate school, I worry about starting over. How will I make friends? How did I make friends my freshman year of college? How did I get acclimated to a new city?",
      "The first step in starting over my freshman year of college was joining my sorority. Even when joining a sorority, I had to start over. I had to introduce myself to new people in order to make new friends. This can be a terrifying thought, but it’s necessary in life. Every step of your life will include starting over in one aspect or another.",
      "Did I know anyone in my sorority before I joined? Absolutely not. I didn’t know a single person as I walked into the room for Bid Day, but I pushed myself to try to meet the people I would call my sisters.",
      "Here are some tips on how you can make friends in a new environment:",
      "*BID DAY",
      "Usually for Bid Day, the new members are provided with a Bid Day Buddy who is an initiated member of the sorority. This is extremely helpful when figuring out what’s going on and having someone to talk to during the event.",
      "Entering Bid Day, I thought I was going in alone, but my Bid Day Buddy helped me to feel comfortable in this new environment. Of course, already initiated women of the sorority are bound to talk to one another, but don’t be afraid to talk to them as well. It’s okay to jump out of your comfort zone and introduce yourself or ask them questions!",
      "As a new member, I was slightly intimidated by the initiated women in my sorority. I felt as if they all knew each other and I wouldn’t be able to become friends with them. This was the fear of starting over speaking to me. Once I pushed myself to talk to the women outside of my new member class, I realized that they are just as excited to make new friends as I was.",
      "*HANG OUT",
      "Don’t be afraid to ask someone in the sorority to hang out with you! Whether they are in your new member class or already initiated, it truly makes a difference when they know you enjoy their company. I know it sounds terrifying and that’s okay. If you’re more comfortable asking someone from your member class to hang out, start with that! They are in the same boat as you, thrown into a new environment and unsure of what to do or how to make friends. ",
      "A simple, “Want to grab dinner after this?” will make them, and you, feel so much better. Most of the time, other people will want to come as well which expands the people you’ll know in your sorority. ",
      "*OFFER YOUR HELP",
      "It’s always nice when someone lends a helping hand. If your sorority is throwing an event, ask how you can help out! The women planning the event will always be grateful to receive help, especially the day it’s happening.",
      "You may ask yourself, “What if they say no?” (I asked myself that plenty of times and they always accepted the help.) It’s okay if they don’t need help! The fact that you asked will stay with them and they’ll most likely reach out for the next event. ",
      "*ENJOY THE RANDOM GROUPING",
      "During the first semester in my sorority, I signed up for a service event in which I was assigned randomly to a car. To say it was uncomfortable is an understatement, but I ended up having a lot of fun once I got passed my initial nerves. I introduced myself and took part in the conversations they had. ",
      "As annoying as it is to be assigned groups, it pays off in the end. If you’re in a large sorority, it can truly be one of the most important ways to meet as many people as possible. It’s normal to be anxious to join a group of people you don’t know, but your sisters are there to help make you feel comfortable!",
      "The most important part of starting over is making sure you are taking the steps to enjoy your new journey!",
      "Shoutout to Katie, Toni, Gabby, and the rest of my MC class for being my day ones. ",

    body: [
      "During my freshman year of college, my roommate asked me one question: Are you going through recruitment?",
      "After asking her what it was, it sounded like something everyone did when they first came to college. So, I agreed to sign up with her.",
      "I was terrified for the first round. I wasn’t sure what to wear and, as an already quiet person, I had no idea what to expect with conversations. The thought of talking to people for hours on end was paralyzing, but I did it. I went through recruitment and received a bid from Sigma Kappa.",
      "Looking back from then, when I had no clue about Greek Life, to now, being my last year in Sigma Kappa, I’m absolutely amazed at what I’ve realized.",
      "*First Things First",
      "As it goes for anything, you get what you put out. In my first two years, I didn’t put much effort into being in a sorority. At first, I wasn’t sure why I was in the sorority, but, then again, I wasn’t sure why I would leave. I had some friends. I had fun at the events. I got a little who turned out to be the perfect match for me. But even with these factors, I wasn’t doing much.",
      "During my junior year, something clicked. For some unknown reason, I ran for a position that allowed me to decorate the room for recruitment. In order to make our room look as well-put together and welcoming as possible, I had to put in the work. Putting in the effort for the room led me to put in effort for recruitment which in turn helped me encourage other girls and allowed me to make friends.",
      "The effort that I put into this allowed me to gain so much love for the sorority. I made new friends, got the courage to speak up or talk to other women in the panhellenic community, and used my love for art to help paint the letters. All the work that I put into the sorority showed me what I was missing—the opportunity to be recognized.",
      "Maybe that was what I was afraid of all along—not being seen.",
      "After this position, I gained courage in myself to run for a higher one. My faith in my ability to lead the chapter as president was slim, but that brings me to second my realization.",
      "*You Have to Grow",
      "In order to achieve anything, whether it be personal, academic or professional goals, you have to grow. Each experience lived through changes you as a person and that is perfectly okay. As humans, we are unable to stay the exact same way our entire life. There is a chance that you won’t be able to see how much you grow, but others will. The women of my sorority saw how much I grew from recruitment alone and trusted me with the position of president.",
      "Within this position, I grew to an extent I never thought possible. My confidence in myself had increased, talking to others became easy for me, and excitement filled my body when events were happening.",
      "How was I able to change so much?",
      "Well, I finally had the courage to...",
      "*Stop Pretending",
      "The most important realization that came from being in a sorority was that I stopped pretending to be someone I wasn’t.",
      "There was a fear inside of me that I was chosen to be in Sigma Kappa because of the person I was perceived to be during recruitment. Perhaps I didn’t realize this fear my freshman and sophomore year, but I was able to see it as I grew. The person I was in my years of questioning my time in the sorority was the person I was trying to be to fit in.",
      "Never pretend to be someone you’re not.",
      "Do not compromise your true self out of fear.",
      "Just as humans are unable to remain the same, a part of who we truly are will always shine through.",

A vintage tank top is such a fun way to spice up a night out, don’t be afraid to crop it! Lastly a structured quality oversized mens blazer can be worn on a night out or to work. ",

        "The most common question I’m asked is:",
        "What was it like being president?",
        "I dread the question because, with all honesty, there is no definite way I can answer it. How do I sum up a year’s worth of memories and experiences into a two second response? I’ve tried to come up with an answer that can explain everything, but it seems impossible. The mini versions of myself are rushing around in my brain, collecting all my presidency files like secretary SpongeBob. ",
        "But, as I sit here writing this, I’ve come up with an answer that requires an explanation and no explanation at the same time. ",
        "It was life changing. ",
        "I know that answer may seem over the top or cliché, but it’s the truth. My experience changed my outlook on so many different aspects of life. ",
        "There are several things in life I take for granted. One of the most important is time. I swear, no matter how hard I try, I never live in the moment. I always worry about the future and that will forever be my fatal flaw. ",
        "If there was one thing I could have asked for, it would be more time with the women in my sorority. Leading them, watching them become courageous, influential women, was the greatest gift I was given, and I wish I had more time. My experience in this position has allowed me to see that time is such a precious thing in life. As I look back on the time I spent with them, I can’t help but be grateful for everything they’ve given me. They trusted me with this position even though I held none previously. They offered help when I needed it. They came to me for advice and opinions. They allowed me to watch them grow. ",
        "Of course, there were difficulties in my position. Issues arose and I was terrified to deal with them. But it seemed, no matter how terrified I was, the women in my sorority weren’t terrified at all. They were hopeful and honest. They had faith in me which only made me want to work ten times harder. The truth is, without the love and respect from these women, I wouldn’t have made it as president. ",
        "The position taught much about the reality of our world. It taught me about the people I may encounter in the workforce. I learned how to handle difficult situations and conversations. I continuously increased my knowledge about finances, contracts, and business proposals. I learned how to abide by the bylaws and communicate effectively with those higher up working for my sorority. It forced me out of my comfort zone, allowing me to create amazing relationships with my school or sorority advisors. It helped me organize myself and my work and even showed me that I do not, no matter how hard I try, rely on a calendar planner. Sometimes, my biggest fear came true, and I messed up, but it taught me that it’s okay to make mistakes. It’s the only way you learn. ",
        "So, when people ask me what it was like being president, how do I respond?",
        "It was good but there were also bad moments. But those bad moments truly turned into an amazing outcome and learning experience. It wasn’t easy but it wasn’t hard because I had the love and support of my sisters. It wasn’t slow because now looking back, time went by so quickly that I almost wish I could watch it happen again just to make sure I actually lived it.",
        "The person I was before I became president is no longer the person I am now. Whether you have a position or not, time continues to push you forward, changing who you were into who you are. ",
        "It was life changing.  "

        "To start off our new series, Sorority Spotlight, we will be taking a look at the first chapter to coin the term “sorority”; Gamma Phi Beta. The sorority was founded on November 11th, 1874, by Frances E. Haven, Helen Dodge, Adeline Curtis, and Mary Bingham. Expanding nationally over the following decades, Gamma Phi Beta became one of the seven founding members of the National Panhellenic Conference’s (NPC) in 1891. The NPC stands today as one of the oldest and largest women’s membership organizations, including 26 sororities and representing over 4 million members.",
        "Gamma Phi Beta’s colors are pink (blush) and brown (a-la-mode), the official flower is a pink carnation, and the symbol is the crescent moon. Their Gamma Phi Beta badge was designed by Tiffany & Co in 1874, and is known around the panhellenic community for its beautiful design.",
        "The sorority currently has over 224,00 members, with an international headquarters based in Centennial, Colorado. At this headquarters, there is a Gamma Phi Beta museum that holds important artifacts to the chapter’s history.",
        "The impact of Gamma Phi Beta reaches far beyond the bounds of its members, continuing to serve as an industry leader in philanthropy. The sorority has recently partnered with Girls on the Run, a non profit organization that strives for a physical activity-based positive youth development (PA-PYD) program designed to enhance girls’ social, emotional and physical skills and behaviors to successfully navigate life experiences.",
        "The members of Gamma Phi Beta have continued to pioneer female excellence in numerous industries over the years, with notable members of the sorority including: Alex Flanagan(sports reporter for ESPN), Jennifer Dunn (Former US Congresswoman), Laurel Clark(NASA Astronaut), and Marguerite Higgins(Pulitzer Prize Winner).
